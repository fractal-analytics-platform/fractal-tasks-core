Fractal tasks core is the official task package for the [Fractal](https://fractal-analytics-platform.github.io/) framework. It provides essential tools for building Fractal tasks, helpful utility functions, and a collection of ready-to-use tasks for processing bioimaging data. These tasks include OME-Zarr conversion, image registration, segmentation, and measurements.

![Fractal overview](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/666c8797-2594-4b8e-b1d2-b43fca66d1df)
Fractal is a framework developed at the [BioVisionCenter](https://www.biovisioncenter.uzh.ch/en.html) to process bioimaging data at scale in the OME-Zarr format and prepare the images for interactive visualization.

## Available Tasks

This package includes the following tasks. For all available Fractal tasks, check the [task list page](all_tasks).

**Image Conversion**:

  - *Convert Cellvoyager to OME-Zarr*: Converts CV7000/CV8000 images to OME-Zarr format.
  - *Convert Cellvoyager Multiplexing to OME-Zarr*: Converts multiplexed images from CV7000/CV8000 to OME-Zarr.

**Image Processing**:

  - *Project Image (HCS Plate)*: Generates intensity projections (e.g., maximum intensity projection) for images in an HCS plate.
  - *Illumination Correction*: Applies flatfield correction and background subtraction using pre-calculated illumination profiles.

**Segmentation**:

  - *Cellpose Segmentation*: Segments images using custom or pre-trained Cellpose models, with user-tunable options.

**Registration**:

  - *Calculate Registration*: Computes translations for aligning images in multiplexed image analysis.
  - *Find Registration Consensus*: Generates consensus transformations for aligning multiple acquisitions, updating ROI tables as necessary.
  - *Apply Registration to Image*: Applies registration to images based on existing or newly created ROI tables.

**Measurements**:

  - *Napari Workflows Wrapper*: Task to run existing napari workflows through Fractal to process images and labels and to generate new labels or measurement tables. Takes an arbitrary napari workflow yaml file to run.

**Other Utilities**:

  - *Import OME-Zarr*: Validates and processes existing OME-Zarr files, adding ROI tables and metadata for further processing in Fractal.
